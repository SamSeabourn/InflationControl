# Built with Svelte

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/main/packages/create-svelte).


## Developing

```bash
yarn dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
yarn dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
yarn build
```

## Formatting your code

To format svelte code:

```bash
yarn format
```

You can preview the production build with `npm preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
